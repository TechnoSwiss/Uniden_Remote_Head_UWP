# Uniden_Remote_Head_UWP
.Net 4.5 UWP Remote Head application for the Uniden BCT15X Scanner

As a UWP application this should run on any device with Win10 installed.
It's been tested on a Lumia 640 and Intel NUC.

It was designed for a Uniden BCT15X scanner, it would probably work with other
Uniden scanners that use the same serial control protocol.

A serial connection to the scanner is required, this can be a serial port on the PC
or for mobile devices a bluetooth to serial adapter. The code is currently written
to connect to a BOLUTEK module.
